# TODO Before Testing

1. Rewire broken connections. Requires the following tools:
    - 28 AWG wire
    - Soldering iron
    - Small flathead
    - Wire holder stand
    - Strippers (unfortunately, just the handheld kind (the ones with handles (damn I'm not making myself clear, the ones that strip the covering off the tip (I mean the one that only costs 10 or so dollars (I give up ); ))))
