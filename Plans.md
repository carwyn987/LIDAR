# TODO Before Testing

1. Rewire broken connections. Requires the following tools:
    - 28 AWG wire
    - Soldering iron
    - Small flathead (smaller than the tip of my cross chain)
    - Wire holder stand
    - Strippers (unfortunately, just the handheld kind (the ones with handles (damn I'm not making myself clear, the ones that strip the covering off the tip (I mean the one that only costs 10 or so dollars (I give up ); ))))
    - Laser goggles specific to blocking 905nm wavelength, just in case disassembly is required
    - Ethernet cable
2. Get a new 3 A automotive blade fuse (there is not one here).
3. Install bmon to verify ethernet communication.
